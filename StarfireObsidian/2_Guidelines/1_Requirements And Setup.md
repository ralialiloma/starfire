### 1.1.1 Device Storage Requirement

**Minimum 300 GB of Free Storage**: Each team member is required to maintain at least 300 GB of available storage on their device. This capacity is necessary to accommodate project files, work-in-progress assets, and other essential data. Please be aware that no exceptions can be made during the project, so please ensure your device has the required storage. Use this software if you have trouble cleaning up files: Â [TreeSize Free](https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free) (Software for seeing what takes up how much storage)

### 1.1.2 Unreal 5.3

Please ensure that you have installed the latest version of Unreal Engine. You can download it from the official website: [Unreal Engine Download](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download). Keep in mind that the storage requirement does not include the installation of Unreal Engine itself; you will need Unreal Engine plus an **additional 300 GB** of free space.

### 1.1.3 Personal Folder Structure

Keep your Project in a dedicated folder for this project in on your drive with 300 GB free storage and try to keep your filepath as short as you can while at the same time following the [Naming And Sorting Conventions](https://www.notion.so/2-Naming-And-Sorting-Conventions-3c4a1d7ebca249ebbeadc6429bc1cc49?pvs=21) even for this filepath.

> [!Never save any project related files in your users folder!]

### 1.1.4 Familiarity With Git

To ensure you possess the necessary skills, it's imperative that you are proficient in Git Merging, including techniques like **Squash And Merge**, and capable of **resolving simple merge conflicts**. Additionally, you should have a **fundamental understanding** of how [Git Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwP7WQkmECE) and Git LFS (Large File Storage) function.

You need to know:

1. **Merging and Squash And Merge:** Understand how to merge branches in Git, including using the Squash And Merge option to consolidate commits and maintain a clean commit history.
2. **Pull Requests:** Be able to create, manage, and review pull requests effectively to propose changes and merge them into the main branch.
3. **File Management:** Familiarize yourself with editing and comprehending the purpose of essential files within the repository, such as .gitignore and .gitattributes, which help manage repository behavior and file tracking.
4. **Handling Binary and Text Assets:** Understand the difference between binary and text-based assets in Git and be aware of which types of assets fall into each category. For instance, Unreal Blueprints are typically binary assets.
5. **Git LFS:** Have a solid understanding of Git Large File Storage (LFS) and its usage in Git repositories, including its purpose in managing large binary files efficiently and how it integrates with Git workflows.

> To validate your skills, I recommend creating your own repository and practicing various Git operations. This includes making pull requests, accepting pull requests, deliberately creating merge conflicts, and learning to resolve them effectively. You can find all the information about it either on [YouTube](http://youtube.com) or in the [Official Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc) **Note** that these processes depending on your previous knowledge might take up a day or two. So plan for that.

## 1.2 Regular Committing

Commit your work regularly, especially after making significant progress or at the end of your work session. Frequent commits, approximately every 6 hours, maintain a detailed and up-to-date history of your work, making it easier for the team to collaborate and track changes effectively.

## 1.3 Git as Primary File Storage

Git will serve as your primary file storage system. You are expected to include all your work-in-progress files, such as .psd or. blend files, in the repository. This practice ensures a seamless transition for team members who may need to continue your work and allows everyone to access essential assets at any time.
